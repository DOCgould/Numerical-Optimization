**Principal Component Analysis and the reported low intrinsic dimensionality of gene expression microarray data**

**Starting with PCA**  
PCA is central to the idea of multivariate data.
The central idea of Principal component analysis is to reduce the dimentianality of a dataset consisting of a large number of interrelated variable, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the dataset. This is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables, the priciple components, which are uncorrelated, and which are ordered so that the first few retain the most of the variation present in all of the original variables.<sup>1</sup>

**Defining the Mathematical terms for PCA**  

*Variance of the variables:* Expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Basically to measure how far a set of random variables are spread out from their avaerage value.<sup>2</sup>  

*Covariance:* How much two random variable vary together. It is very similar to the concept of variance; but, where variance tells about how much a single variable varies, covariance talks about how two variables vary together.<sup>3</sup>
