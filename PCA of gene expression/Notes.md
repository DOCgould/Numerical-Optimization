- PCA [Principal Component Analysis] is a common unsupervised method for analysis of gene expression microarray data, providing information   on the overall structure of the analysed dataset.
- It is applied to various datasets of many different tissues and cell to create a low dimensional global map of human gene expression.
- The paper intends to show that **linear instrinsic dimensionality of the global map is higher than previously reported.**
- Analysis of cases when PCA fails to detect biologically relevant information and provide methods to overcome the limitations.
- Shows that PCA depends on the effect size of the biological signal as well as on the fraction of samples containing the signal.

**Principal Component Analysis**  
1. It provides a fully unsupervised information on the dominant directions of the highest variability in the data and thus help investigate similarities between individual samples or formation of clusters.
2. Most of the studies just concentrate on the first two to four pricipal components assuming the higher order components contain irrelevant data.
