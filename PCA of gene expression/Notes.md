- PCA [Principal Component Analysis] is a common unsupervised method for analysis of gene expression microarray data, providing information   on the overall structure of the analysed dataset.
- It is applied to various datasets of many different tissues and cell to create a low dimensional global map of human gene expression.
- The paper intends to show that **linear instrinsic dimensionality of the global map is higher than previously reported.**
